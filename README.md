## Read Me - Paul I Toro Portfolio
This portfolio is a cumulation of work done at CUNY Tech Works at QueensBorough Community College and through Columbia Engineering Bootcamp.
Ive tried to incorporate HTML,CSS, ANd some JAVA Script in my projects. 

I've decided to keep all my projects in the projects page to demonstrate and show my progression.

I really like the web design aspect, in the near future more projects will be added with other technicality of the design and coding.
